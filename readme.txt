Network
This is a simple app to track servers and create build scripts.

Deploy:
You will need to create a config file at /usr/local/etc/network-config.groovy.  You can copy the file from ExternalConfs to use as a template.
You will need to make sure the database you selected in the local config file has been created.  The application will populate it with tables.
After creating the config file, you can create the war file (grails war) and copy it to your app server.
